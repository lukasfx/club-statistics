**Club Statistics**

Imports data on Berlin clubs from http://clubkataster.de into a Pandas dataframe, in order to enable further research and statistics. This project was build in December 2018 during the 35th Chaos Communication Congress in Leipzig, Germany (#35C3).
If you want to try it out, but don't have Pandas, Python, etc. installed, you can play with the data on mybinder.org. The link is:
